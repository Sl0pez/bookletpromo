        <h2>about the author</h2>
        <p>I'm Santiago Lopez. I'm currently a sophomore at the New School majoring in Journalism and Design. The inspiration for this zine comes from my frustration with commute and the realization that there's always someone out there with a commute that's much worse than mine.</p>
